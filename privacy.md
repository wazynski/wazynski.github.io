We respect the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and this policy explains how we collect and treat any information you give us. You won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We’ve no desire to trick you into agreeing to something you might later regret.

We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.

## How we collect information

Our website uses a single cookie that is necessary to serve our website, \_cfduid, provided by Cloudfare. DNS records held at Cloudflare enable us to provide a secure connection, they set this cookie to identify your device as trusted. You can find out more about it [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-Cloudflare-cfduid-cookie-do-).

Our website doesn’t use cookies or scripts that were designed to track the websites you visit. We don’t use analytics or native social media ‘like’ or ‘sharing’ buttons which also build profiles of your internet activity.

We collect your email address and any other contact details your volunteer when you contact us via email.

We ask for contact information when you hire or buy something from us.

Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of our partners. If we do, we protect it in exactly the same way as if you give it to us directly.

## What information we hold

When you contact us by email or phone, we collect your name, email address, phone number, the company you work for, if you’ve given us that.

If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and address details and keep records of the estimates, invoices and contracts we send you and the payments you make.

All purchases are processed by directly through bank payment or [stripe](https://stripe.com/gb/privacy), our online card payment platform and we never have access to your credit card information.

## Where we store your information

When you contact us by email or through our website, we store your your information in [G Suite](https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/), our Email provider and Cloud software. If we do business, we store your information in our accounts software, [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/privacy) and our eSignature software for digital contracts, [Dropbox Sign](https://www.dropboxsign.com/). We chose these systems partly for their commitment to security.

## What we use your information for

We will use your contact information to provide our services that you have requested. We might also email or phone you about our products and services, but if you tell us not to, we won’t get in touch again. We will use your information to send you invoices, statements, or reminders and any other documents relevant to providing our services.

## Who’s responsible for your information at our company

Thomas Skarbek-Wazynski, our director, is responsible for the security of your information. You can contact them by email at [tom@ninesenses.co.uk](mailto:tom@ninesenses.co.uk) or by phone on [07535644344](tel:07535644344) if you have any concerns about the information we store.

## Who has access to information about you

When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access. We do not work with third party marketing companies and will only ever pass your details to suppliers or consultants as part of a project which you have engaged us to work on and with your permission.

If we are required to pass on your personal details for legal reasons, we will do this to comply with the law and its requirements in that particular situation.

## The steps we take to keep your information private

Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it. We store passwords in [1password](https://1password.com/), an encrypted password manager, use a different, randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice.

The computers we use are all encrypted using [FileVault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault) and are protected by a passcode or fingerprint access. These computers ask for authentication whenever they’re started or after 5 minutes of inactivity. Our mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or facial recognition.

## Access to the information we hold on you

You have the right to access any information we hold on you. This request is free of charge and we will stop using the information during the period of request and reply. To request access to your data contact Thomas Skarbek-Wazynski by email at [tom@ninesenses.co.uk](mailto:tom@ninesenses.co.uk) or by phone on [07535644344](tel:07535644344).

## How to complain

We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we handle your privacy, please contact Thomas Skarbek-Wazynski by email at [tom@ninesenses.co.uk](mailto:tom@ninesenses.co.uk) or by phone on [07535644344](tel:07535644344). If you’re the letter writing type, send your envelope to 12 Birch Way, Poulton-le-Fylde, FY6 7SF.

If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment we publish them on our website.
