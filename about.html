testimonial: >-
  <p>
    Tom has, not only an exceptional talent for development & programming, but an acute eye for design too. It’s this multi-faceted approach that makes Tom stand out. He can see problems and solutions from more perspectives than most. Always finds a way to ‘hit the nail on the head’ in terms of functionality, usability, robustness, and not to mention aesthetics.
  </p>
  <p>
    He always has new and innovative solutions, keeping up with the times and always looks to better his work. I wouldn’t hesitate in recommending him to anyone.

<p>
  A designer &amp; full stack developer with over 9 years experience. I enjoy working with a diverse range of clients. Planning, designing and developing, extraordinary brands, websites, and apps.
</p>

<p>
  I’m also a keen photographer, although I spend far too much time taking photos and never using them. Yet, I do give away them away royalty free on <a target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@wazynski">Unsplash</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Previously, I was the lead innovation developer at Lancaster University, where I helped to start the <a target="_blank" href="http://itpi.lancaster.ac.uk/innovation/">Innovation Hub</a>. Before that, I was a design partner at <a target="_blank" href="http://singlemaltdesign.co.uk">Single Malt</a> and a co-founder and lead developer of <a href="/case-studies/porters-trading-limited">Porter's Coffee</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I also enjoy a good whisky or classic Negroni.
